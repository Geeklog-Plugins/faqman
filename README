FAQ Manager plugin 0.9.1 for Geeklog 2.1.3 and later                2018-06-06

This is another updated and repackaged version of the FAQ Manager plugin,
originally released by Blaine Lang.

the Geeklog Upgrade procedure and the icon not appearing in the Geeklog control 
panel.

FAQ Manager plugin 0.9.0 for Geeklog 2.1.3 and later                2017-12-10

This is another updated and repackaged version of the FAQ Manager plugin,
originally released by Blaine Lang.

This version raises the minimum requirement to Geeklog 2.1.3 and uses standard
the file-based template system.  Other than that, the functionality 
remains unchanged.

FAQ Manager plugin 0.8.1 for Geeklog 1.5.0 and later                2008-12-07

This is another updated and repackaged version of the FAQ Manager plugin,
originally released by Blaine Lang.

This version raises the minimum requirement to Geeklog 1.5.0. The install
script no longer requires register_globals = on. As a technical side note, it
also makes use of Geeklog's auto-uninstall for plugins now. Other than that,
the functionality remains unchanged.

See below for a list of changes in the previous release.

faqman reloaded                                                     2006-06-30

This is a repackaged version of the faqman 0.8 plugin (faqman_0.8_1.3.8.zip),
originally released by Blaine Lang.

Only the following three files differ from the original:

- functions.inc
- public_html/index.php
- language/german.php

The functions.inc was originally released separately on 2004-11-26 and includes
these changes:

- fixes problems with single quotes in search queries
- adds a check for faqman.edit permissions before adding an entry to
  the Admin's block
- includes support for the [faq:] autotag (requires Geeklog 1.3.10 or later).
  see <http://www.geeklog.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=42186>
  for details

The index.php has been rewritten so that it does not use the faqman's template
files any more which makes it integrate more nicely into Geeklog. Please note
that the admin portions of this plugin still use their own template system
which is known to "leak" CSS rules into Geeklog, resulting in odd color changes.

The German translation (german.php) has been added for this release.
